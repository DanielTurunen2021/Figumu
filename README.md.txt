# Figumu
FutureGames 2021 Game Project 1

Figumu was the first project I worked on at FutureGames in Stockholm together with 9 other students. Two 3D artists, four designers and three programmers. I made the menus, the player controls(mouse controls)
, a radial script and did a lot of the audio implementation in the game.
